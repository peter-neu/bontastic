## BLE connection Proof-of-concept


Goal: Connect to a Bluetooth device with a bluetooth pairing code, using the ESP32 Nimble library by h2zero.

Caveats:
Do not confuse the syntax! Check the repository with tool-calls if necessary [Nimble Library](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino)


Style-Guide:
Since we want to create an POC and evaluate and learn the code, do NOT:

- Create "fluff" like error handling, unnecessary case matching etc.
- Do not write verbose code
- Do not put comments in the code 

Instead:
- be concise
- keep it simple!
- minimum neccessary code
